10. - If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-> Yes, it's called Overloading Method
 
15. Passing parameter
1, Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
->  JAVA is always a pass by value programming language.
2, After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
-> Because just passing the value of two objects, not two objects
3, After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
-> Because dvd.setTitle() is a setter will make change, the "dvd = new DVD(oldTitle) just change the dvd'clone value
